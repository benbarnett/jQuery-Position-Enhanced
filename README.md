jquery.position-enhanced plugin
===============

Extends jQuery.position() to collect translated position in addition to native method

Tested with jQuery 1.3.2 to 1.6.2

What it does
-----------------

Extends the native $.position() method to detect CSS3 translations that have affected the position of the element. This isn't required in Webkit, but currently Firefox (including v7) reports 0.

Use it in exactly the same way as you would $.position() - http://api.jquery.com/position/
